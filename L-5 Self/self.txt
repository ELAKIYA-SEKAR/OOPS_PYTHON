which object we are working on is self

when we dont specify self and execute
we get 
check_balance() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given


sbi.check_balance()--> check_balance(sbi)-->method(self)

Inside a class there are data and methods both these can be accessed by the classe's objects
a method cannot call/access another method in class

it access through object eg.sbi,hdfc methods can only access other methods through object that is self
self.check_balance() not check_balance()


“self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used.

udemy- user -student(login ,register,enroll,revision)
   instructor(login,register,create,answer)

in both the users login and register is common

so user(login,register)- student and instructor

DRY- dont repeat your codes

code reusability

student can inherit user but
user cant inherit student

can inherit datamemebers,member function(methods),constructor

privat members can be inherited (self.__name) _Access specifiers,modifiers
